In this project, we use the NIH Chest X-ray Dataset which comprises of over 1 lakh frontal-view X-ray images
with labels for each image specifying the presence/absence of 14 common thorax diseases.
We develop a model for multi label image classification and weakly supervised pathology localization framework,
which detects the presence of multiple diseases and also generates bounding boxes around the corresponding disease.
